# Learn platform

In progress material for <https://docs.polygon.technology/innovation-design/>,
to be rebranded as Learn. Content managed by the
[Polygon Devrel team](https://polygon.technology/community/meet-the-devrel).

## Content

External contributors should feel at home grabbing some of the incomplete topics
and sending in PRs with drafts. If you run into a tutorial about Polygon's tech
stack in the wild that isn't mentioned here, please feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/0xPolygon/devrel-docs/issues) or
[contact us](https://polygon.technology/community/meet-the-devrel) to discuss
adding it.

## The Community

Join our community in the [R&D Discord](https://discord.gg/0xpolygonrnd), or
schedule a meet with us at
[Meet The Devrel](https://polygon.technology/community/meet-the-devrel).

Additionally, we have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@0xPolygonTV)
and a [Polygon blog](https://polygon.technology/blog).

Long-form persisted discussions happen in the
[Developer Forum](https://forum.polygon.technology/).

## Contributing

The process below will help you run the docs locally.

### Repo Translations

- [x] English
- [ ] Chinese
- [ ] Thai

Please [get in touch](https://polygon.technology/community/meet-the-devrel) if
you want to help translate this into other languages.

### Prerequisites

1. [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install [`virtualenv`](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/):

```sh
pip3 install virtualenv
```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. `cd` to the root.
3. Run the `scripts/serve_docs.sh` script. You may need to make the script
   executable: `chmod +x scripts/serve_docs.sh`

```sh
sh scripts/serve_docs.sh
```

The site comes up at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>.

If it runs and renders well here, it will render correctly on the Knowledge
Layer. If there are any unfixed errors breaking the local build, it will
probably break on import to the Knowledge Layer.

### Linting

There is a linting script at `./prettier.sh` which you can run if you have Prettier installed. The `.prettierrc` file is used to configure Prettier and should work with most modern IDEs and build processes.
