## Content

External contributors should feel at home grabbing some of the incomplete topics
and sending in PRs with drafts. If you run into a tutorial about Polygon's tech
stack in the wild that isn't mentioned here, please feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/0xPolygon/devrel-docs/issues) or
[contact us](https://polygon.technology/community/meet-the-devrel) to discuss
adding it.

Please note that if you PR some of your content in, it is not guaranteed to be
published. If we do accept it, we will be modifying it to fit the style of the
rest of the site. You will get full credit for your work.

## Contributing

The process below will help you run the docs locally.

### Prerequisites

1. [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install [`virtualenv`](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/):

```sh
pip3 install virtualenv
```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository:

   ```sh
   cd devrel-docs
   ```

3. Ensure the `serve_docs.sh` script is executable by running:

   ```sh
   chmod +x serve-docs.sh
   ```

4. To serve the documentation, run the following command:

   ```sh
   ./serve_docs.sh
   ```

5. Once the script executes, the documentation site will be accessible at:
   <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>.

If it runs and renders well here, it will render correctly on the Knowledge
Layer. If there are any unfixed errors breaking the local build, it will
probably break on import to the Knowledge Layer.

## Commands

- `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
- `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
- `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
- `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

### Linting

There is a linting script at `./prettier.sh` which you can run if you have
Prettier installed. The `.prettierrc` file is used to configure Prettier and
should work with most modern IDEs and build processes.

Main rules:

- use 2 spaces for indentation
- use 80 characters for line length

Other rules are loosely based on the
[Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).
