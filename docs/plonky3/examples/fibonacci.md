## Understand Fibonacci AIR Example

So now that we briefly walked through [what Plonky3 is and how does it work](../overview.md), let's see this simple hands-on example to learn more!

We will walk through our fibonacci example code via blow steps

<center>Steps of how to create a zk system using Plonky3</center>

### Step One: Define your Program

First you will need to understand what is the computation you want to prove, in our case is a program that calculates Fibonacci sequence after `n` of steps.

Then we have requirements of:
1. The program must always start with 0 and 1 as the initial inputs
2. Each iteration will have two inputs and a output. The second input of the current input will become the first input of the next iteration, and the sum of the current two inputs will become the second input of the next iteration.
3. Will iterate `n` steps based on the configuration, and its result will be different according to numbers of steps iterated.

### Step Two: Define your AIR Constraints

Now that we have our program logic thought out, we will convert them into AIR Constraints.

AIR Constraint is about working with the execution trace, where you can imagine it as a 2D-matrix. Each row represents the current iteration of the computation, and the width of the each row represents the elements that are associated with the whole computation. Basically, in a zkVM context, this could mean that the width of the row is all the registers in this zkVM system, and each row iteration is the transition of all registers from one PC count to next.

>**Tips on defining your AIR Scripts:**
>1. Define the valid state transition, aka what are the constraints when transitioning from one row to the one below it
>2. Define relations among the fields in the same row if needed, sometimes we have constraints that are only about a single column as well, like if a column is supposed to be 0 or 1 we do x (x - 1) = 0 (or assert_bool() shorthand)
>3. Define constraints on initial state, if the program has to be ran starting with specific initial state
>4. Define constraints on ending state, if the program result needs to be public at the end of execution in this program.

In our example, Fibonacci program, creating AIR constraints are fairly simple, each row is the current 2 numbers to be added, so the width will be 2. Every row will have a relations of:
1. Second field of the current row is the first field of the next row
2. The sum of the both fields of the current row is equal to the second field of the next row

Also we need to make sure that our program starts with 0 and 1 for the correct execution, as well as, verify the final execution result is the same as expected result.

```rust
// Define your AIR constraints inputs via declaring a Struct with relevant inputs inside it.
pub struct FibonacciAir {
    pub num_steps: usize, // numbers of steps to run the fibonacci iterations
    pub final_value: u32, // precomputed final result after the numbers of steps.
}

// Define your Execution Trace Row size, 
impl<F: Field> BaseAir<F> for FibonacciAir {
    fn width(&self) -> usize {
        2 // Row width for fibonacci program is 2
    }
}

// Define your Constraints
impl<AB: AirBuilder> Air<AB> for FibonacciAir {
    fn eval(&self, builder: &mut AB) {
        let main = builder.main();
        let local = main.row_slice(0); // get the current row
        let next = main.row_slice(1); // get the next row

        // Enforce starting values
        builder.when_first_row().assert_eq(local[0], AB::Expr::zero());
        builder.when_first_row().assert_eq(local[1], AB::Expr::one());

        // Enforce state transition constraints
        builder.when_transition().assert_eq(next[0], local[1]);
        builder.when_transition().assert_eq(next[1], local[0] + local[1]);

        // Constrain the final value
        let final_value = AB::Expr::from_canonical_u32(self.final_value);
        builder.when_last_row().assert_eq(local[1], final_value);
    }
}
```

### Step Three: Define your Execution Trace

Third step is to define the function to generate your program's execution trace. The general idea is to create a function that keeps track of all relevant state of each iteration, and push them all into a vector, then at last convert this 1D vector into a Matrix in the dimension that matches your AIR Script's width.

```rust
pub fn generate_fibonacci_trace<F: Field>(num_steps: usize) -> RowMajorMatrix<F> {
    // Declaring the total fields needed to keep track of the execution with the given parameter, which in this case, is num_steps multiply by 2, where 2 is the width of the AIR scripts.
    let mut values = Vec::with_capacity(num_steps * 2); 
    
    // Define your initial state, 0 and 1.
    let mut a = F::zero();
    let mut b = F::one();

    // Run your program and fill in the states in each iteration in the `values` vector
    for _ in 0..num_steps {
        values.push(a);
        values.push(b);
        let c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }

    // Convert it into 2D matrix.
    RowMajorMatrix::new(values, 2)
}
```

If you are curious how the execution trace looks like, here's the execution trace of running 8 steps of Fibonacci program.

| col 0 | col 1 |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 5 | 8 |
| 8 | 13 |
| 13 | 21 |

We now have both AIR scripts and execution trace ready.

### Step Four: Choose your Field and Hash Functions

Now it is time to start layout our zk system. We first start with your `Field` and `Hash Function` of choice

```rust
// Your choice of Field
type Val = Mersenne31;
// This creates a cubic extension field over Val using a binomial basis. It's used for generating challenges in the proof system.
// The reason why we want to extend our field for Challenges, is because the original Field size is too small that can be brute-forced to solve the challenge.
type Challenge = BinomialExtensionField<Val, 3>;

// Your choice of Hash Function
type ByteHash = Keccak256Hash;
// A serializer for Hash function, so that it can take Fields as inputs
type FieldHash = SerializingHasher32<ByteHash>;
// Declaring an empty hash and its serializer.
let byte_hash = ByteHash {};
// Declaring Field hash function, it is used to hash field elements in the proof system
let field_hash = FieldHash::new(Keccak256Hash {});
```

### Step Five: Write your ZK System Setup

This is a very generic setup and its ready to used in all kinds of ZK systems. So generally you can just copy paste the blow code and use it in your own ZK systems.

1. First setup is to define the Compression function, it is used in the MMCS (Multi-Merkle Commitment Tree) construction process. 
2. Use the Field, Field Hash function and the compression function to create MMCS instance, we shall call this `ValMmcs`.
3. Extend the `ValMmcs` instance created from previous step into the same extension field as `Challenge` from Step Four, we call it `ChallangeMmcs`
4. Define a `Challenger` for Proof Generation (its necessary in the PIOP process), which will be used in STARK configuration. Basically creating random challenge inputs for PIOP process.
5. Define `fri_config`, then it is used to create `Pcs` (Polynomial Commitment Scheme).
6. At last, with `Pcs`, `Challenge`, `Challenger` prepared, we use them to define our STARK configuration.

```rust
// Defines a compression function type using ByteHash, with 2 input blocks and 32-byte output.
type MyCompress = CompressionFunctionFromHasher<u8, ByteHash, 2, 32>;
// Creates a new instance of the compression function.
let compress = MyCompress::new(byte_hash);

// Defines a Merkle tree commitment scheme for field elements with 32 levels.
type ValMmcs = FieldMerkleTreeMmcs<Val, u8, FieldHash, MyCompress, 32>;
// Instantiates the Merkle tree commitment scheme.
let val_mmcs = ValMmcs::new(field_hash, compress);

// Defines an extension of the Merkle tree commitment scheme for the challenge field.
type ChallengeMmcs = ExtensionMmcs<Val, Challenge, ValMmcs>;
// Creates an instance of the challenge Merkle tree commitment scheme.
let challenge_mmcs = ChallengeMmcs::new(val_mmcs.clone());

// Defines the challenger type for generating random challenges.
type Challenger = SerializingChallenger32<Val, HashChallenger<u8, ByteHash, 32>>;

// Configures the FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon IOP) protocol parameters.
let fri_config = FriConfig {
    log_blowup: 1,
    num_queries: 100,
    proof_of_work_bits: 16,
    mmcs: challenge_mmcs,
};

// Defines the polynomial commitment scheme type.
type Pcs = CirclePcs<Val, ValMmcs, ChallengeMmcs>;
// Instantiates the polynomial commitment scheme with the above parameters.
let pcs = Pcs {
    mmcs: val_mmcs,
    fri_config,
    _phantom: PhantomData,
};

// Defines the overall STARK configuration type.
type MyConfig = StarkConfig<Pcs, Challenge, Challenger>;
// Creates the STARK configuration instance.
let config = MyConfig::new(pcs);
```

### Step Six: Prove & Verify

After the long process of defining the ZK setup, its time to use it to prove and verify our program!

```rust
// First define your AIR constraints inputs
let num_steps = 8; // Choose the number of Fibonacci steps.
let final_value = 21; // Choose the final Fibonacci value

// Instantiate the AIR Scripts instance.
let air = FibonacciAir { num_steps, final_value };
// Generate the execution trace, based on the inputs defined above.
let trace = generate_fibonacci_trace::<Val>(num_steps);

// Create Challenge sequence, in this case, we are using empty vector as seed inputs.
let mut challenger = Challenger::from_hasher(vec![], byte_hash);
// Generate your Proof!
let proof = prove(&config, &air, &mut challenger, trace, &vec![]);

// Create the same Challenge sequence as above for verification purpose
let mut challenger = Challenger::from_hasher(vec![], byte_hash);
// Verify your proof!
verify(&config, &air, &mut challenger, &proof, &vec![])
```

### Result

If all of the above code works, this is the output you can expect:
```rust
cargo run
```
