# ZK Learning Resources

Diving into ZK can be a bit overwhelming, but there are many resources available
to help you get started. Here are some of the best places to start. These are
best followed in order and are ideal if you're new to the topic, especially if
you don't have a heavy math background.

We recommend reading through [Key Concepts](./key_concepts.md) first to absorb
some of the coming "jargon".

- [Zero Knowledge Proofs Illustrated Primer](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/):
  A great primer on ZKPs by one of the most respected cryptographers in the
  field.
