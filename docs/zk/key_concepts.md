# Key Concepts

As you learn about zero-knowledge proofs, you'll encounter many key concepts. In
these documents, we'll attempt to demistify them in a way that'll be
understandable to those new to the field, especially those without a math or
cryptography background.

Keep in mind that the ZK world is hard to absorb if you're new to it. You should
not expect to understand everything in your first read. Indeed, truly grasping
ZK concepts will take several months at the very least.

Persistence is key, and as always, getting your hands dirty with code and our
interactive examples will provide you with the most benefit.

This is an evolving subsection, so expect the structure to change and the
[resource list](./learning_resources.md) to grow as we polish the flow.
