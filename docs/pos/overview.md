# Polygon PoS Overview

Polygon PoS (Proof-of-Stake) is a blockchain network that operates as a
sidechain, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It aims to provide faster
and cheaper transactions while leveraging the security of the Ethereum mainnet.

The technical details about Polygon PoS are available in the
[official documentation](../pos/).

> Originally launched as Matic Network in June 2020, Polygon PoS has undergone
> numerous upgrades since its inception. Initially designed to scale Ethereum
> through a sidechain, a
> [new proposal on the Polygon forum](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-42-polygon-2-0-upgrade-pos-staking-to-use-pol/17683)
> suggests upgrading Polygon PoS into a zero-knowledge (ZK)-based validium on
> Ethereum. Polygon PoS will soon adopt the execution environment of Polygon
> zkEVM along with a dedicated data availability layer. This new architecture
> would be inherently interoperable with a broader network of ZK-powered
> Ethereum L2s via the [AggLayer](../agglayer/overview.md). Polygon PoS will
> continue to be the foundational infrastructure for a wide array of
> decentralized applications and services.
