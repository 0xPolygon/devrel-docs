# CDK Overview

Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) is an innovative toolkit designed for
blockchain developers who want to create customizable layer 2 (L2) chains. It
empowers developers to launch new L2 chains that leverage Polygon's zkEVM
technology on Ethereum, with the option to use validium networks. In the future,
CDK will also support transitioning existing layer 1 chains into custom ZK-EVM
L2s.

    To learn about CDK's technical details, architecture, and how to deploy
    its parts, please see the
    [CDK technical docs](../cdk/).

This document will evolve as it dives in depth explaining every part of the CDK,
deploying each element of the Kurtosis stack separately, and showing you how
_the machine_ works. Reading this subsection will make you a theoretical CDK
expert, and will be most useful for implementation providers looking to build on
top of CDK for other projects.
